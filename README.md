# Eleventy Blog

Elusive blog content using the [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) 
[ JAM stack ](https://jamstack.org/) generator.

## Getting Started

- I am using a template found here: [Eleventy Duo](https://github.com/yinkakun/eleventy-duo)
which provided me with very easy way to simply drop my liquid template markdown files
from Jekyll, right into the eleventy structure.

- Simplifying my site is my goal, and I am not done trying. The switch to Eleventy is 
just a start. My ultimate goal is to just have a home page and blog posts with every-
thing being a markdown file or markdown liquid template file.

- Use `yarn run dev` to build a development version of the site. Output is in the 
public folder.

## More Information
The site is hosted by my AWS free account as it is small static files and I have
virtually no traffic. This whole thing is really just an exercise in learning how
to do it all. 

I am using github and github actions to host the code and to generate and deploy
the site to the S3 bucket it lives inside. Inspiration for my hosting and AWS setup
was found at <mads-hartmann.com>.

Isn't Jamstack beautiful?
