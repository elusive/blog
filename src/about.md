He is an autodidact software engineer, born in the mid-1970s with over 20 years in the industry, about half web development and half desktop.

He values the truth above all (reality is the only truth there is).

He values learning, self-reliance, books and movies that make him laugh or smile or cry, and loyalty in friends.

He grew up in a lower middle class neighborhood in Louisville, Kentucky. He was raised by a single mother, meeting his father later in his childhood.

He is currently partnered with a beautiful woman named Jane Kim whom he met one evening in April of 1999. They live together in Lakewood, Colorado where the climate is arid and sunny.
